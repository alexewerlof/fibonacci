# Introduction

This repo contains two algorithms for computing nth number in the factorial serie using JavaScript's new `BigInt` data type.
These two algorithms show the difference between the na√Øve implementation and a
[smarter one](http://raganwald.com/2015/12/20/an-es6-program-to-compute-fibonacci.html) that uses matrices (**13x faster**).
_The algorithms on that page had some bugs that I had to fix._

# Run

`$ node .`
